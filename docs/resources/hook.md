# bitbucket\_hook

Provides a Bitbucket hook resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "bitbucket_hook" "deploy_on_push" {
  owner       = "myteam"
  repository  = "terraform-code"
  url         = "https://mywebhookservice.mycompany.com/deploy-on-push"
  description = "Deploy the code via my webhook"

  events = [
    "repo:push",
  ]
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `owner` - (Required) The owner of this repository. Can be you or any team you

* `url` - (Required) Where to POST to.
* `description` - (Required) The name / description to show in the UI.
