# bitbucket\_branch\_restriction

Provides a Bitbucket branch restriction resource.

This allows you for setting up branch restrictions for your repository.

OAuth2 Scopes: `repository:admin`

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "bitbucket_branch_restriction" "master" {
  owner      = "myteam"
  repository = "terraform-code"

  kind = "push"
  pattern = "master"
  
  groups {
    slug = "my-group"
    owner = "my-owner"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `owner` - (Required) The owner of this repository. Can be you or any team you
  have write access to.
* `repository` - (Required) The name of the repository.
* `kind` - (Required) The type of restriction that is being applied. Valid values can be found in [docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-branch-restrictions/#api-group-branch-restrictions).
* `branch_match_kind` - (Optional) Indicates how the restriction is matched against a branch. The default is `glob`. Valid values: `branching_model`, `glob`.
* `branch_type` - (Optional) Apply the restriction to branches of this type. Active when `branch_match_kind` is `branching_model`. The branch type will be calculated using the branching model configured for the repository. Valid values: `feature`, `bugfix`, `release`, `hotfix`, `development`, `production`.
* `pattern` - (Optional) Apply the restriction to branches that match this pattern. Active when `branch_match_kind` is `glob`. Will be empty when `branch_match_kind` is `branching_model`.
* `users` - (Optional) A list of users to use.
* `groups` - (Optional) A list of groups to use.
* `value` - (Optional) A value applied to the restriction kind. Currently only applicable to `require_passing_builds_to_merge`, `require_default_reviewer_approvals_to_merge` and `require_approvals_to_merge`.

## Import
